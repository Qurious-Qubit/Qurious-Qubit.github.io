            <p>
              If you're studying signals and systems, here's a moment of cognitive whiplash that many encounter: we say a system is <strong>Linear Time-Invariant (LTI)</strong> — its behavior doesn't change with time — but then we describe it using $h(t)$, an <strong>impulse response that is clearly a function of time</strong>. How can something that doesn't change over time have a response that varies with time? Isn't this a contradiction?
            </p>
            <p>
              It's not. It's a beautiful subtlety that reveals how we characterize systems versus how systems actually behave. Let's unravel this.
            </p>

            <h2>The Setup: Meet $h(t)$, the System's Fingerprint</h2>
            <p>
              For any LTI system, $h(t)$ is its complete signature. It's defined as the output you get when you feed the system an <strong>impulse</strong> (a Dirac delta function $\delta(t)$) at time $t=0$.
            </p>
            <div style="text-align:center; margin: 20px 0;">
              <strong>Impulse Input:</strong> $\delta(t)$ → <strong>System $S$</strong> → <strong>Output:</strong> $h(t)$
            </div>
            <p>
              For example, an RC low-pass filter has impulse response:
            </p>
            <div style="text-align:center; margin: 20px 0;">
              $h(t) = \frac{1}{RC} e^{-t/(RC)} u(t)$
            </div>
            <p>
              This $h(t)$ definitely varies with $t$: it's large right after the impulse, then decays exponentially. So why isn't the system "changing with time"?
            </p>

            <h2>The Core Insight: It's Not About the System Changing</h2>
            <p>
              Here’s the crucial distinction: <strong>$h(t)$ describes how the system's single response to an impulse evolves over time, not how the system's rules change over time.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Think of it this way: If you strike a bell at noon, the ringing sound lasts for several seconds. The fact that the sound amplitude decreases over time doesn't mean the bell's physical properties are changing with each passing second. The bell is the same; you're just observing the <em>aftermath</em> of a single event.
            </p>
            <p>
              Similarly, $h(t)$ is the "ringing" of the system after being "struck" by an impulse. The system's nature — its differential equation, its circuit components, its coefficients — remains constant. It’s still the same bell.
            </p>

            <h2>Time-Invariance: The Real Test</h2>
            <p>
              Time-invariance has a precise mathematical meaning: If you shift the input in time, the output shifts by the same amount, <em>and nothing else changes</em>.
            </p>
            <div style="text-align:center; margin: 20px 0;">
              If $x(t) \rightarrow y(t)$,<br>
              then $x(t - \tau) \rightarrow y(t - \tau)$ for any $\tau$.
            </div>
            <p>
              This is perfectly satisfied by an LTI system. If you apply the impulse at $t=10$ instead of $t=0$, the response will be $h(t-10)$ — the same shape, just shifted.
            </p>
            <p>
              The time variable $t$ in $h(t)$ is <strong>observation time</strong>, not <strong>system evolution time</strong>.
            </p>

            <h2>The Superpower: Convolution</h2>
            <p>
              Why do we care so much about $h(t)$? Because it lets us predict the system's response to <em>any</em> input $x(t)$ via convolution:
            </p>
            <div style="text-align:center; font-size: 1.2em; background-color:#f9f9f9; padding:10px; border-radius:5px; margin: 20px 0;">
              $y(t) = (x * h)(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x(\tau) \, h(t - \tau) \, d\tau$
            </div>
            <p>
              Convolution is essentially a weighted sum of time-shifted impulse responses. Each little piece of the input $x(\tau)$ creates a scaled, shifted copy of $h(t)$, and we add them all up.
            </p>
            <p>
              The fact that this works for any input — using only $h(t)$ — is the miracle of LTI systems. One experiment (impulse test) tells you everything.
            </p>

            <h2>Transfer Function: The Frequency-Domain View</h2>
            <p>
              Sometimes the time-domain view with $h(t)$ feels tangled. We can transform to the frequency domain using the Laplace or Fourier transform:
            </p>
            <div style="text-align:center; margin: 20px 0;">
              $H(s) = \mathcal{L}\{h(t)\}$ &nbsp;&nbsp; or &nbsp;&nbsp; $H(j\omega) = \mathcal{F}\{h(t)\}$
            </div>
            <p>
              $H(s)$ or $H(j\omega)$ is the <strong>transfer function</strong>. It is <em>not</em> a function of time — it's a function of complex frequency $s$ or angular frequency $\omega$.
            </p>
            <p>
              Here, the time-invariance is obvious: $H$ has no explicit dependence on $t$. The system's dynamics are captured purely in terms of how it treats different frequency components.
            </p>

            <h2>Analogies from Daily Life</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>Echo in a Canyon:</strong> If you shout once, the echo lasts several seconds ($h(t)$). If you shout 5 seconds later, you get the same echo pattern, just 5 seconds later. The canyon isn't changing; you're just hearing the consequence of one shout over time.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Glass of Water:</strong> Drop a pebble into still water. Ripples spread out and fade. The way ripples evolve is $h(t)$. Drop another pebble later, and the ripple pattern is the same, just time-shifted. The water's properties didn't change between drops.
            </p>

            <h2>The Mathematical Takeaway</h2>
            <p>
              Time-invariance means the system's differential equation has constant coefficients:
            </p>
            <div style="text-align:center; margin: 20px 0;">
              $a_n \frac{d^n y}{dt^n} + \dots + a_0 y = b_m \frac{d^m x}{dt^m} + \dots + b_0 x$
            </div>
            <p>
              The solution to this equation when $x(t) = \delta(t)$ is $h(t)$, which is a function of $t$. But the coefficients $a_i, b_i$ are constants, independent of $t$. That’s the heart of it.
            </p>

            <h2>Conclusion: Embracing the Dual Nature of $h(t)$</h2>
            <p>
              The impulse response $h(t)$ is a function of time because it tells a story: the story of what happens after an impulse. But the system telling that story is constant. The paradox dissolves when we realize we’re describing the plot, not the author.
            </p>
            <p>
              In signals and systems, $h(t)$ is both a time-domain signature and a timeless blueprint. It varies with $t$, yet it describes a system that doesn’t vary with $t$. This duality is precisely what makes LTI systems so powerful and elegant — and so wonderfully confusing at first encounter.
            </p>
            <p>
              Next time you see $h(t)$, remember: you're looking at the echo of a single shout in a canyon that never changes. The canyon is time-invariant; the echo is a function of time. Both can be true.
            </p>
