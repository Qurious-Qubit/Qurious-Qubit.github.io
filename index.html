      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>
        We are a collective of inquisitive minds - students, enthusiasts, and lifelong learners
        driven by a passion for delving into the realms of magnetics, quantum science, analog electronics, AI & ML and what not everything.
        From biology to social sciences, from history to geography - anything that exists, has existed, could exist or even couldn't exist. 
        We are simply curious about it all.
      </p>
      <p>
        This blog serves as our digital canvas, where we document our explorations, share our projects,
        reflect on the knowledge we acquire, and provide a platform for anyone interested to share their insights.
        A space where curious minds can get noticed without getting washed away in the vast ocean of big websites 
        and social media platforms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our journey began with a simple question: "What if we could make complex concepts 
        accessible to everyone?" From that spark of curiosity, Qurious-Qubit was born. We believe that 
        the most profound discoveries happen at the intersection of different fields, which is why we 
        explore connections without boundaries - bridging quantum physics with biology, classical electronics 
        with social sciences, and artificial intelligence with history. No subject is off-limits in our 
        quest for understanding.
      </p>

        Whether you're here to learn, collaborate, or simply satiate your curiosity,
